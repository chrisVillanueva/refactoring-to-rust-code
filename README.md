# Code from for Refactoring to Rust

This repository contains all of the code listings from the new book,
_Refactoring to Rust_. Listings are organized by chapter number and listing
number in the text. Larger examples, which may not be expressible in a single
listing, are given their own directories.

## Running the code

Most of the examples are written in Rust or Python 3. The latest Rust
compiler can be installed by following the instructions at https://rustup.rs/

The simpler Rust examples can be tried in a web browser without installing
any software, by visiting https://play.rust-lang.org/

**IMPORTANT**: Some sections of the book illustrate compiler errors that
developers new to Rust can commonly make. Listings which have NO_COMPILE in
the directory names are expected to fail to compile.
